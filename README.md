# Life-Expectancy-Dataset-


`1.1 Introduction`<br>
In this project, data was gathered from kaggle to help gain an insight into life expectancy. There are many factors that can effect the length of a person's life. This information will hopefully help guide policymakers to make changes to help increase the life expectancy of their people.

`1.2 Questions`<br>
        1.2.1 What factors have the most influence on Life Expectancy?<b>
  
        1.2.2 Can we predict how long a person will live on average?<br>
  
        1.2.3 How does obesity relate to life expectancy?<br>
  

`1.3 Process`<br>
        1.3.1 See data_cleaning_engineering.ipynb: This file contains the seperate data files obtained through Kaggle. The data was sorted through, analyzed, cleaned and concatted into one.<br>
  
        1.3.2 See data_visualization.ipynb: To see how the data looked, a of hypothesis testing were ran and graphed.<br>
  
        1.3.3 See regression_analysis.ipynb: Lastly, used linear regression techniques to create the most accurate model into predicting life expectancy.<br>
  

`1.4 Libraries`<br>
        1.4.1 Matplotlib<br>
  
        1.4.2 Seaborn<br>
  
        1.4.3 Plotly<br>
  
        1.4.4 Pandas<br>
  
        1.4.5 SkLearn<br>
  
        1.4.6 statsmodels<br>
  

`1.5 Findings`<br>
Through data analysis, factors such as Schooling, Obesity, Alcohol Consumption, Immunization, Percentage Expenditure, and country had the highest impact in predicting life expectancy with a Root Mean Squared Error of only 0.25 Standard deviation. This is important because policy makers can take these findings and create changes in the law to better serve their people.<br>
         1.5.1 Schools should be made more accessible and more prevalent.`<br>
  
         1.5.2 Countries who have a lower life expectancy should increase their healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan.<br>
  
         1.5.3 Governments should allocate more budget into physical and mental health to help increase life expectancy and quality of life.<br>
